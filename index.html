            <h3>Curtis Brown, Producer</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              A Toronto based producer and founder of Brown Stub Productions. He
              has helped develop musicals like Come From Away & The Theory of
              Relativity with the Canadian Music Theatre Project, The Girl Who
              with Noisemaker (UK) , Bloodless: The Trail of Burke and Hare with
              Theatre 20 and Columbus: The Musical with Royal Caribbean Cruise
              Lines.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Curtis' love for capturing stories on screen, along with his
              life-long passion for musical theatre, led him to produce “Before
              They Were Them” which premiered at the TIFF Lightbox in November
              2019. He holds a Master of Arts Degree from the Royal
              Conservatoire of Scotland and an Advanced Diploma from Sheridan
              College.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Along with his education, Curtis’ experience within the
              entertainment industry working with leading Broadway and West end
              creatives has helped him garner the skills to develop and produce
              meaningful, respected and well-crafted work.
